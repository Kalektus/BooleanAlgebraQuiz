In short, I implemented:
- Multiple ways to display questions (with image, without image, more/less button selection)
- There are currently 8 questions, I am adding more
- The code is structured through 3 scripts that spin the functions for work, I commented the code in Croatian
- The buttons react to the selection and give visual information whether the answer is correct (green) or wrong (red)
- the keys are turned off after the answer so that the user cannot type until the next question
- Added audio effect for correct and incorrect answer and background music
- I made the background of the game in photoshop
- Added system for tracking results and saving the best (high score)
- The game is compatible with most mobile devices
- Main menu scene
- Options screen with sound control
- pause menu with volume control and flow to main menu
- new UI design
